# TanStack AI — Core Concepts

TanStack AI is a type-safe, provider-agnostic AI SDK. Server-side functions
live in `@tanstack/ai` and provider adapter packages. Client-side hooks live
in framework packages (`@tanstack/ai-react`, `@tanstack/ai-solid`, etc.).
Always import from the framework package on the client — never from
`@tanstack/ai-client` directly (unless vanilla JS).

## Quick Decision Tree

- Setting up a chatbot? → ai-core/chat-experience
- Adding function calling? → ai-core/tool-calling
- Generating media (images, audio, video)? → ai-core/media-generation
- Need structured JSON output? → ai-core/structured-outputs
- Choosing/configuring a provider? → ai-core/adapter-configuration
- Building a server-only AG-UI backend? → ai-core/ag-ui-protocol
- Adding analytics or post-stream events? → ai-core/middleware
- Connecting to a custom backend? → ai-core/custom-backend-integration
- Turning on debug logging to trace chunks/tools/middleware? → ai-core/debug-logging
- Debugging mistakes? → Check Common Mistakes in the relevant sub-skill

## Critical Rules

1. **This is NOT the Vercel AI SDK.** Use `chat()` not `streamText()`. Use `openaiText()` not `createOpenAI()`. Import from `@tanstack/ai`, not `ai`.
2. **Import from framework package on client.** Use `@tanstack/ai-react` (or solid/vue/svelte/preact), not `@tanstack/ai-client`.
3. **Use `toServerSentEventsResponse()`** to convert streams to HTTP responses. Never implement SSE manually.
4. **Use middleware for lifecycle events.** No `onEnd`/`onFinish` callbacks on `chat()` — use `middleware: [{ onFinish: ... }]`.
5. **Ask the user which adapter and model** they want. Suggest the latest model. Also ask if they want Code Mode.
6. **Tools must be passed to both server and client.** Server gets the tool in `chat({ tools })`, client gets the definition in `useChat({ clientTools })`.
